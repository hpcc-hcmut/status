# Statsig's Open-Source Status Page

We tried various Status Pages out there, and built this as a fun little hobby project to make status pages as simple as possible.

## Demo

- https://status.statsig.com

## Setup instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Update `urls.cfg` to include your urls.

```cfg
key1=https://example.com
key2=https://statsig.com
```

3. Update `index.html` and change the title.

```html
<title>My Status Page</title>
<h1>Services Status</h1>
```

4. Set up GitHub Pages for your repository.

## How does it work?

This project uses Github actions to wake up every hour and run a shell script (`health-check.sh`). This script runs `curl` on every url in your config and appends the result of that run to a log file and commits it to the repository. This log is then pulled dynamically from `index.html` and displayed in a easily consumable fashion. You can also run that script from your own infrastructure to update the status page more often.

## What does it not do (yet)?

1. Incident management.
2. Outage duration tracking.
3. Updating status root-cause.

## Got new ideas?

Send in a PR - we'd love to integrate your ideas.
